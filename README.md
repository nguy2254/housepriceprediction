# housepriceprediction
This repository provides the codes to build the House Price Dataset from scratch using web-scraping, and implement house price predictions with the popular machine learning approaches on the House Price Dataset also from scratch.

It includes two parts.
## Part 0: BUILD MODEL FROM SCRATCH
- [x] 1. Linear Regression - [link](https://github.com/nguy2254/housepriceprediction/blob/master/Linear%20Regression_GSD.ipynb)
- [x] 2. Logistic Regression - [link](https://github.com/nguy2254/housepriceprediction/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb) 
- [ ] 3. Gradient Boosting
- [x] 4. Neural Net  - [link](https://github.com/nguy2254/housepriceprediction/blob/master/Neural%20Net%20implementation.ipynb)
## Part 1: WEB SCRAPING DATA  - ZILLOW DATA 
- [x] 1. Create the list of US Zipcode - Done 
- [ ] 2. Download price from US Zillow - Done
- [ ] 3. Create clean dataset

## Part 2: HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
- [ ] 1. Simple Linear Regression
- [ ] 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- [ ] 3. Penalized Linear Regression
- [ ] 4. Gradient Boosting 
- [ ] 5. Random Forest 
- [ ] 6. Decision Tree
